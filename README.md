### SMART (Soil Monitoring Application Real Time)
The Smart Soil Monitoring System is a project aimed at providing real-time monitoring of soil conditions, including pH, soil moisture, and temperature. This system utilizes a device equipped with sensors to collect data from the soil and a web interface to display the data to users. Additionally, the system includes threshold notifications to alert users when soil conditions exceed predefined thresholds.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of soil pH, soil moisture, and temperature.
- Continuous data collection and display through a web interface.
- Threshold notifications to alert users when soil conditions exceed predefined thresholds.
- Interactive graphs for visualizing soil condition trends over time.
